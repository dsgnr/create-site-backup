This is a bash script to back up a WordPress website database and filesys to another location on the same server.

You will need to modify the script to set where your sites are stored, as well as where your backup destination will be.

This script also assumes that you have WP-CLI installed correctly on the server.

I accept no responsibility for any loss or damage to anything. If you do not know what you are doing, do not use this script.
